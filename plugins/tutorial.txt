COMMANDS

Command.Register syntax:

Command.Register(CommandName, FunctionToCall, NumArgs, Description, AdminOnly)

NumArgs is the minimum number of arguments required for the function to be called.

FunctionToCall are called with the following arguments:

FunctionToCall(UserName, Nick, HostMask, Arguments, AllArguments, IsPm)

Arguments is a table of words after the command. AllArguments is a string with all of them.

Example:
function MyCommand( UserName, Nick, HostMask, Arguments, AllArguments, IsPm)
         print(Nick.. " executed a command with arguments: " .. AllArguments)
end

Command.Register("MYCOMMAND", MyCommand, 0, "MYCOMMAND - This is a description.", false)

HOOKS

Hooks are simply events. They're what links the IRC library to the plugins in the first place.
Use hook.Add to add a function to a hook:
hook.Add(HookType,UniqueName,Function)

HookType is the hook type to hook to the function. UniqueName is the string name of your current hook. Used in hook.Remove.

Example:
function MyChatHook(user, mask, room, nick, msg)
         print(nick.." sent a message in ".. room.."!")
         print(msg)
end

hook.Add("RecieveChat","MyRecieveChatHook",MyChatHook)

( If you want to make your own hook type, use hook.Call(YourHookName,arg1,arg2,etc) )

To remove a previously registered function, use hook.Remove:
hook.Remove("RecieveChat","MyRecieveChatHook")

Would remove the hooked function in the previous example.
